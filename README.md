# Hotel Landing Page - Next.js Project

Welcome to the Hotel Landing Page project! This Next.js application provides a foundation for creating an engaging landing page for a hotel. It is bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app) to ensure a quick and efficient setup.

## Getting Started

To run the project locally, follow these steps:

### 1. Navigate to Project Directory

Open your terminal and navigate to the project directory:

```bash
cd hotel-landing-page
```

### 2. Install Dependencies

Install the required Node modules using the following command:

```bash
npm install
# or
yarn
# or
pnpm install
# or
bun install
```

### 3. Run the Development Server

Start the development server with one of the following commands:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Visit [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser to view the application. The page auto-updates as you make changes to the code.

## Customization

You can start customizing the page by modifying the `app/page.js` file. The project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.

## Additional Information

- Explore the [Next.js documentation](https://nextjs.org/) for in-depth information on Next.js features and capabilities.
- For font optimization details, refer to the [`next/font` documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization).

Feel free to adapt and extend this project to meet your specific requirements. Happy coding!
